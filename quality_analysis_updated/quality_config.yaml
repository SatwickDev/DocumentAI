recommendations:
  blur_score:
    good:
      - "Image is almost sharp. Minor improvement possible via gentle sharpening."
      - "For pre-processing: try a light unsharp mask or edge enhancement filter."
    medium:
      - "Slightly improve focusâ€”avoid scanning through plastic covers."
      - "For pre-processing: apply mild sharpening to enhance numbers and lines."
    low:
      - "Retake the scan or photo using a steady hand and flat surface."
      - "Ensure the page is not wrinkled or folded."
      - "For pre-processing: try gentle deblurring algorithms."
  sharpness_score:
    good:
      - "Sharpness is decent. Try a gentle sharpening for better clarity."
      - "For pre-processing: light edge enhancement may help."
    medium:
      - "Increase scanning resolution for better readability."
      - "For pre-processing: use edge enhancement filters."
    low:
      - "Check that the scanner glass is clean and the page is flat."
      - "For pre-processing: apply gentle sharpening."
  contrast_score:
    good:
      - "Contrast is nearly optimal. Consider local contrast enhancement for small improvement."
      - "For pre-processing: a minor CLAHE (adaptive histogram equalization) may help."
    medium:
      - "If possible, scan in greyscale/binary for crisp text."
      - "For pre-processing: use adaptive contrast enhancement."
    low:
      - "Increase scanner contrast or scan in 'text' mode."
      - "For pre-processing: apply contrast stretching or adaptive histogram equalization."
  noise_level:
    good:
      - "Noise level is acceptable. Minor denoising can be applied for perfection."
      - "For pre-processing: try conservative denoising if needed."
    medium:
      - "Reduce background artifacts (stamps, marks) if possible."
      - "For pre-processing: use conservative denoising."
    low:
      - "Clean the scanner glass and avoid patterned backgrounds."
      - "For pre-processing: apply noise reduction filters."
  brightness_score:
    good:
      - "Brightness is good. Ensure even lighting across the page."
      - "For pre-processing: minor local brightness normalization may help."
    medium:
      - "Ensure the entire page is evenly lit, especially at the edges."
      - "For pre-processing: use local brightness adjustment."
    low:
      - "Increase ambient light or scanner brightness to avoid dark backgrounds."
      - "For pre-processing: apply brightness correction."
  skew_angle:
    good:
      - "Alignment is good. For strict accuracy, slight deskewing can be performed."
      - "For pre-processing: apply gentle deskew if required."
    medium:
      - "Slightly rotate the page for better alignment."
      - "For pre-processing: use rotation correction."
    low:
      - "Align the document with scanner/camera guides for bank forms."
      - "For pre-processing: apply deskewing algorithms."
